# Gluetun Monitor - Sites to test for VPN connectivity
# Add one URL per line
# Lines starting with # are comments
#
# All sites are tested in parallel. If any site fails consecutively
# (based on FAIL_THRESHOLD), Gluetun will be restarted.
#
# Tips:
# - Use HTTPS sites for reliable connectivity testing
# - Include sites you actually need to reach through the VPN
# - Mix general sites with service-specific endpoints
# - More sites = more comprehensive testing (minimal overhead due to parallel execution)
